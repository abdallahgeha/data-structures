npm run dev
```

Building the project

```
npm run build
```

## Description

Technologies used:  
- Nextjs: A React server rendering framework with TypeScript support  
- React:  React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript.  
- Vercel: Used for deploying the project    

## Description

GWAB Data Structures is the best place to start learning about data structures.  
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.  
  
Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.  
  
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.  
  
Learning to code by yourself, or in bootcamps poses the challenge of learning different data structures, as they wont be a main focus. This is where GWAB comes in and offers a place to learn data structures at your own pace.  
  
## Roadmap

Implementing more Data Structures into the project is always in progress.  
Looking into adding algorithms as well, but this will be after Data Structures are fully developped and stabilized.  

## Contributing  

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Influence
This Project was heavily influenced by Oleksii Trekhleb's (Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript)[https://itnext.io/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-javascript-a71548f902cb] and checking out his repository is very much recommended.
