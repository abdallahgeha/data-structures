  paragraph: `Welcome To GWAB (Gorilla With A Banana) a personal project of mine, where I plan to learn (TypeScript, React, Nextjs, Data Structures, Algorithsms) 
  hoping it could be a help to others as well to learn from.
  
  At first let me give a small background about me.
  I am have a Masters in Structural Engineering from Budapest University of Technology and Economics BME, while doing my MSc thesis during my last semester, I had a task that I was required to repeat more than 150 times.
  I thought to my self there must be a better way, I am too lazy to do this.
  That is when I found I could program this task using a language called APDL (a propretary language specific to ANSYS) That is when I found a joy in programming.
  After that I decided to start learning Full-Stack development, and enrolled in a coding bootcamp here in budapest (GreenFox Academy) this is where my coding journey started.`
